## NOTE TAKER

## PURPOSE
This app allows a user to create and save notes, view previously saved notes, and delete previously saved notes. For people who need to keep track of a lot of information, it's easy to forget or be unable to recall something important. Being able to take persistent notes allows users to have written information available when needed. This application uses an express backend to save and retrieve note data from a JSON file.
